# rev.ng CI regression script
# This script is run after the `ci-run.sh` has run and has successfully
# promoted a next-develop branch to develop. The purpose of this script is to
# promote the develop branch to master. The prerequisites for this are:
# * Passing some form of regression (typically, `mass-testing-regression`)
# * If present, a downstream pipeline which is expected to trigger downstream
#   tests and finish successfully if those pass
# If the above happens then the develop branches are promoted to master
# (triggering binary archive hooks in the process) and, if present, the
# downstream pipeline is triggered again.
#
# Mandatory environment variables:
#
# REGRESSION_TARGET_COMPONENT: name of the orchestra target to build to test regression
# REVNG_ORCHESTRA_URL: orchestra git repo URL (must be git+ssh:// or git+https://)
#
# Optional environment variables:
#
# SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: private key used to push binary archives
# LFS_RETRIES: Number of times lfs pull/push operations are retried. Defaults to 3.
